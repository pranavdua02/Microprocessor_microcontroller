## 8051 Microcontroller

### Architecture üèõÔ∏è
The 8051 microcontroller is a popular 8-bit microcontroller designed by Intel in 1980. Its architecture includes:
- **8-bit CPU**: Can access 8-bit data at a time.
- **16-bit Program Counter (PC)**: Points to the next instruction to be executed.
- **8-bit Processor Status Word (PSW)**: Holds status flags.
- **128 bytes of RAM**: For data storage.
- **4 KB of ROM**: For storing program code.
- **32 I/O pins**: Configured as four 8-bit ports.
- **Two 16-bit Timers/Counters**: Used for timing operations.
- **Full Duplex UART**: For serial communication.
- **Interrupt System**: Supports up to 5 vectored interrupts.

### Functionality ‚öôÔ∏è
- **I/O Operations**: Interact with external devices via 32 I/O pins.
- **Timers/Counters**: Measure time intervals or count external events.
- **Serial Communication**: Communicate with other devices using UART.
- **Interrupt Handling**: Respond to external or internal events promptly.

### Specifications üìê
- **Clock Frequency**: Typically 12 MHz.
- **Instruction Cycle**: 1 microsecond (at 12 MHz clock).
- **Instruction Set**: 111 instructions, including arithmetic, logic, data transfer, and control instructions.
- **Power Consumption**: Low power operation modes available.

### Communication Principles üîÑ
- **UART Communication**: Uses Start and Stop bits for asynchronous data transmission.
- **I2C and SPI**: Can be implemented using software for communication with peripherals.
- **Parallel Communication**: Utilizes I/O ports for interfacing with devices in parallel mode.

## 8085 Microprocessor

### Architecture üèõÔ∏è
The 8085 is an 8-bit microprocessor introduced by Intel in 1976. Key components include:
- **8-bit Data Bus**: Transfers data.
- **16-bit Address Bus**: Addresses up to 64KB of memory.
- **Accumulator**: 8-bit register used for arithmetic and logic operations.
- **Six General Purpose Registers**: B, C, D, E, H, and L, which can be combined as register pairs.
- **Program Counter (PC)**: 16-bit register pointing to the next instruction.
- **Stack Pointer (SP)**: 16-bit register pointing to the top of the stack.
- **Instruction Register and Decoder**: Decodes the fetched instruction.
- **ALU (Arithmetic and Logic Unit)**: Performs arithmetic and logic operations.
- **Control Unit**: Generates control signals for executing instructions.

### Functionality ‚öôÔ∏è
- **Data Transfer**: Moves data between registers, memory, and I/O ports.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, increment, and decrement.
- **Logic Operations**: AND, OR, XOR, complement.
- **Control Operations**: Manage program flow (e.g., jumps, calls, and returns).
- **I/O Operations**: Interact with external devices through ports.
- **Interrupt Handling**: Supports multiple interrupts for handling events.

### Specifications üìê
- **Clock Frequency**: Typically 3 MHz.
- **Instruction Cycle**: 320 nanoseconds (at 3 MHz clock).
- **Instruction Set**: 74 instructions, including data transfer, arithmetic, logic, control, and branching instructions.
- **Power Consumption**: Operates at 5V with power-saving HALT and HOLD modes.

### Communication Principles üîÑ
- **Serial Communication**: Implemented using SID (Serial Input Data) and SOD (Serial Output Data) lines.
- **Parallel Communication**: Uses address and data buses for parallel data transfer.
- **Interrupt System**: Includes vectored interrupts and non-vectored interrupts for handling different priority levels.
